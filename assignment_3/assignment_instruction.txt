Design a network architecture for a platform that will serve as a real estate finder. People will come and search for houses, bid on them, chat with the buyer/seller. The platform will fetch data from many 3rd party services for different countries and cities. The networking architecture must support 2 regions and 2 availability zones. Developers will be using the network to do development work as well
