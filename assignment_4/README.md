# Fullstack CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions (Next.js & NestJS)

This repository demonstrates how to set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a project that includes both a Next.js frontend and a NestJS backend using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is configured to automatically lint, check code quality, and run unit tests for both applications on every push or pull request to the `feature/*` branches.

## Project Overview

This project combines Next.js, a powerful React framework for server-rendered and static web applications, with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. The CI pipeline ensures that every code change in both the frontend and backend is automatically tested and validated, maintaining the integrity and quality of the codebase.

## CI Pipeline Overview

The CI pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Trigger Events**:

   - The workflow is triggered on `push` events to any `feature/*` branches.
   - The workflow also triggers on `pull_request` events targeting these branches.

2. **Jobs**:

   - **Frontend Linter**: Runs ESLint to check for code style issues in the Next.js frontend.
   - **Frontend Code Quality**: Performs additional code quality checks for the Next.js frontend.
   - **Frontend Unit Tests**: Executes unit tests for the Next.js frontend.
   - **Backend Linter**: Runs ESLint or TSLint to check for code style issues in the NestJS backend.
   - **Backend Code Quality**: Performs additional code quality checks for the NestJS backend.
   - **Backend Unit Tests**: Executes unit tests for the NestJS backend.
   - **Merge Feature Branch to Dev**: Merges the feature branch into the `dev` branch upon successful completion of previous jobs.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - The project uses `pnpm` for package management, which is set up in the workflow before running any jobs.

## Repository Configuration

To ensure smooth operation of the CI pipeline, please note the following:

1. **Branch Configuration**:

   - Your repository must have a `dev` branch where feature branches will be merged.

2. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the repository has the appropriate permissions to allow the CI workflow to read and write for merging operations. This typically requires write access to the `dev` branch and the ability to push changes.

## How to Set Up

To replicate this CI pipeline in your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Next.js and NestJS Project**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest frontend
   pnpm dlx nest new backend
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub Repository**:

   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Push your Next.js and NestJS project to this repository.

3. **Add the CI Workflow**:

   - Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file in your repository with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Fullstack CI Pipeline (NextJs & NestJs)

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - "feature/*"
