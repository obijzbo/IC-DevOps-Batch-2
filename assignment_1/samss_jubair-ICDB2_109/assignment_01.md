# Git and GitHub Cheat Sheet

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

### Types of VCS:
- **SVN (Apache Subversion):** Centralized VCS.
- **Git:** Distributed VCS, developed for Linux.

### Platforms:
- **GitHub:** Git hosting service owned by Microsoft.

## Key Concepts

### Commit Conventions:
1. Use present tense.
2. Capitalize the first word.
3. Keep PRs concise and avoid including too many files.

### Branch Management:
- For large teams, using forks can be more efficient than managing multiple branches.

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines:
- Provide a detailed description for every PR.
- If a PR breaks, both the reviewer and developer share responsibility (50-50).

### Authentication:
- SSH is used for secure authentication.

### Terminology:
- **GitHub:** Uses "Pull Request".
- **GitLab:** Uses "Merge Request". Both are equivalent.

### Commit Management:
- Avoid minor commits like "fix typos"; amend such commits instead.
- Use rebase to stack new changes on top of previous commits.

### Licensing:
- Some companies purchase GitHub/GitLab licenses and host them on their own domains.
